## Introduction
The outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has created a need for efficient and accurate diagnostic tools. This project focuses on utilizing deep learning algorithms to predict Covid-19 infection based on chest X-ray images. By providing a reliable and automated prediction mechanism, we aim to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing Covid-19 cases quickly and accurately.


## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset by organizing Covid-19 positive and negative chest X-ray images.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Train the model using the provided scripts. Adjust hyperparameters as necessary.
4. Evaluate the trained model on the test set to measure its performance.
5. Use the trained model to make predictions on new chest X-ray images.

For detailed instructions and code examples, please refer to the project's documentation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of chest X-ray images from various sources. Due to privacy and legal considerations, we cannot provide the dataset directly in this repository. However, you can find publicly available datasets that contain Covid-19 positive and negative X-ray images from reputable sources such as [COVID-19 Image Data Collection](https://github.com/RishitToteja/Chext-X-ray-Images-Data-Set/tree/main/DataSet/Data).

## Model Training
The model training process involves the following steps:
1. Preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, normalization).
2. Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
3. Implement and train a deep learning model using the provided code.
4. Optimize the model's hyperparameters and architecture.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
6. Save the trained model for future use.

Refer to the project's documentation for more details on the model architecture and training process.

## Results
Our trained model achieved an accuracy of around 95% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in Covid-19 prediction using X-ray images.
