# COVID-19-Prediction-Using-Chest-X-Ray-Images

![Project Preview](https://medicaldialogues.in/h-upload/2023/03/09/204246-chest-x-rays.webp)

This project aims to predict Covid-19 infection using X-ray images of patients' chests. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can analyze the X-ray images and classify them as either Covid-19 positive or negative.

## Introduction
Welcome to the Data Science Interview Preparation repository! This resource is designed to help you prepare for data science interviews by providing a curated set of coding questions and examples in Python and SQL. By leveraging real-world scenarios and practical challenges, we aim to enhance your problem-solving skills and boost your confidence during interviews.


## Usage
Follow these steps to make the most of this repository:

1.Explore Python Coding Questions: Navigate to the Python folder to find a collection of coding questions related to data science. Each question comes with a detailed explanation and solution to help you understand the underlying concepts.

2.Explore SQL Coding Questions: Similarly, check out the SQL folder for a series of coding questions that are commonly asked in data science interviews. Practice your SQL skills and gain confidence in handling database-related problems.

Dataset: Although specific datasets are not provided in this repository due to privacy and legal considerations, you are encouraged to use publicly available datasets from reputable sources. The dataset mentioned in the provided link is an example of what you might use for your practice.

Model Training (for illustrative purposes): While the primary focus is on coding questions, there's a section on model training to provide an overview of the process. This includes steps like preprocessing data, splitting datasets, implementing a basic model, optimizing hyperparameters, and evaluating model performance.

Results: Though the main emphasis is on coding skills, a section on results illustrates the concept of measuring model performance. It's a demonstration of what success might look like in a different context.

For detailed instructions and code examples, please refer to the project's documentation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of chest X-ray images from various sources. Due to privacy and legal considerations, we cannot provide the dataset directly in this repository. However, you can find publicly available datasets that contain Covid-19 positive and negative X-ray images from reputable sources such as those provided in the [link](https://github.com/RishitToteja/Chext-X-ray-Images-Data-Set/tree/main/DataSet/Data).

## Model Training
The model training process involves the following steps:
1. Preprocess the images (e.g., resizing, normalization).
2. Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
3. Implement and train a deep learning model using the provided code.
4. Optimize the model's hyperparameters and architecture.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
6. Save the trained model for future use.

Refer to the project's documentation for more details on the model architecture and training process.

## Results
Our trained model achieved an accuracy of around 95% on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in Covid-19 prediction using X-ray images.
